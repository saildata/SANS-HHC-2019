Welcome to KringleCon 2: Turtle Doves!

Greetings, holiday travelers! Welcome to the North Pole for KringleCon 2: Turtle Doves, Santaâ€™s conference run in association with the SANS Holiday Hack Challenge 2019.

As you enter the North Pole and visit Elf University, make sure you stop by Santa himself along the way. After you chat with Santa in the Elf U quad, your KringleCon badge on your avatar will be populated with a series of objectives for the Holiday Hack Challenge. Just click on your badge to see your objectives.

Also, please do keep an eye on your badge for updates on the narrative and various happenings around Elf U during the con!

Here are some tips to get you exploring:

    Bounce around the environment using the mouse or the arrow keys.
    The chat bar is located on the bottom of the screen, and the pane on the right shows messages from nearby players.
    Focus the chat by pressing Enter, then typing your message.
    Send the message by pressing Enter.
    Scroll the chat pane to view the latest message.
    Use the menu at the top right to access your profile and edit your avatar, log out, hide the chat, or mute the music (who would ever want to do that?!?!).
